crusty bits
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is my personal playground for Rusty code.  This is all MIT licensed.
None of this is meant to be production-ready code, but I would like to at
least try to write good and useful code, so feel free to PR improvements.

A random collection of tiny Rust libraries for common tasks:

``libpcre2``
    Bindings to libpcre2
``simple_regex``
    Regular Expressions -- pretty much fubar, need to go read a book
``reqeasy``
    HTTP client

The primary goal of all crates here is to be easy to use, and fast to
build.
